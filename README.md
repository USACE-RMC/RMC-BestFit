# RMC-BestFit
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Risk Management Center (RMC), in collaboration with the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL), developed the Bayesian estimation and fitting software (RMC-BestFit) to enhance and expedite flood hazard assessments within the Flood Risk Management, Planning, and Dam and Levee Safety communities of practice.

RMC-BestFit is a menu-driven software package, which performs distribution fitting and Bayesian estimation from a choice of thirteen probability distributions. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry capabilities, distribution fitting analysis, Bayesian estimation analysis, and report quality charts.
